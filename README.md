# runfinder
Runfinder was a web app I developed during my last quarter at UCLA (2019). It finds runs down a mountain using as might be used by a skier or snowboarder using a greedy least-cost path algorithm.

I haven't deployed this application since 2019. A video demo of the last deployed version is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5er4wMpkic).
